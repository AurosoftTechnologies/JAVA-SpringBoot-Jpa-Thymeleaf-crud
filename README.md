# JAVA-SpringBoot-Jpa-Thymeleaf-crud-using-Lombok

This project is a Spring Boot application developed using Lombok, a library that simplifies Java class development by automatically generating boilerplate code. The purpose of this project is to showcase the benefits of using Lombok in a Spring Boot application and provide an understanding of its usage in conjunction with Git for version control.

Project Overview
The Spring Boot project with Lombok leverages the power of Lombok's annotations to streamline the development process. Lombok eliminates the need to write repetitive code, such as getters, setters, constructors, and logging statements, by annotating the class and fields appropriately. This approach reduces boilerplate code, improves code readability, and enhances development productivity.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Spring Boot project structure, with the inclusion of Lombok annotations to simplify class development. Key components include:

Model Classes: The model classes define the application's domain entities. With Lombok, these classes can be annotated with @Data to automatically generate getter and setter methods, @NoArgsConstructor to generate a no-argument constructor, and @AllArgsConstructor to generate a constructor with all fields.

Repository Classes: The repository classes handle data access and persistence. These classes typically extend Spring Data JPA repositories and do not require any specific Lombok annotations.

Service Classes: The service classes contain the application's business logic. Lombok annotations are not mandatory for service classes, but they can be used to simplify the implementation by generating common methods such as toString, equals, and hashCode using @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, etc.

Controller Classes: The controller classes handle HTTP requests and responses. While Lombok annotations are not essential for controllers, they can be utilized to generate logging statements, such as @Slf4j for loggers, to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

Configuration and Utility Classes: Additional classes, such as configuration classes (e.g., database configuration) and utility classes, can also benefit from Lombok annotations. For example, @Getter and @Setter can simplify property access in configuration classes, while @UtilityClass can be used for utility classes to generate a class-level singleton instance.
